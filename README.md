# pdfeditor
PDF editor is a Python project that is used to edit PDF files through various ways, by using graphics (pygame) and various other python libraries to access the PDFs

By using PDF editor you will be able to:
- convert an image to PDF
- split a PDF file to its pages
- merge 2 or more PDF files to one new file
- detect words inside a PDF file
- extract tables from PDF files (beta)





Import the following libraries (you will need to pip install them first):
- PyPDF2
- Pillow
- tabula-py


!Data folder contains images used by pygame inside main.py

!OUTPUT FOLDER DOES NOT HAVE TO BE DOWNLOADED



The following Window will open while running main.py:



![monitor](https://github.com/etecnos/pdfeditor/blob/main/output/monitor.png?raw=true)


Each image corresponds to a certain function executed by the program.

After finishing an operation you can close the window and have your PDF ready! If you need anything else you will need to reopen the program.

!Update: the program now restarts 3 seconds after performing an atcion
